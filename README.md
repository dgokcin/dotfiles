## 🎯 Cursor Rules System

Our Cursor rules system, inspired by [cursor-auto-rules-agile-workflow](https://github.com/bmadcode/cursor-auto-rules-agile-workflow), provides an intelligent framework for standardizing development practices.

### Rule Categories

- **core-rules**: Core rule format and management, foundational rules for the system
- **documentation**: Documentation standards and formatting rules
- **global-rules**: Global rules that apply across all contexts
- **tool-rules**: Tool-specific rules and configurations
- **workflows**: Workflow templates and process standards

### Rule Structure

Each rule follows a standardized format:

```yaml
---
name: Name of the rule
description: ACTION when TRIGGER to OUTCOME  # Critical for agent-selected rules, blank for others
globs: pattern to match files  # Critical glob pattern for auto rules, blank for others
alwaysApply: true|false  # Determines if rule is applied to every request
---
```

#### Rule Types

- **Agent Selected**: Agent sees description and chooses when to apply
- **Always**: Applied to every chat and cmd-k request
- **Auto Select**: Applied to matching existing files
- **Auto Select+desc**: Better for new files, includes description
- **Manual**: User must reference in chat

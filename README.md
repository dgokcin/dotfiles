# dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles and configurations, carefully crafted to optimize my development environment. Each dotfile is tailored to a specific task, designed to streamline my workflow and maximize productivity.

## Overview

- **vim**: Configurations for Vim, including plugins and key mappings for efficient text editing. This is now deprecated in favor of neovim.
- **neovim**: Configurations for neovim, including plugins and key mappings for efficient text editing. LazyVim is used as the baseline configuration.
- **vsvim, ideavim, gvim,**: Additional configurations for various text editors to improve coding experience. No longer used.
- **vscodevim**: Legacy configuration for the VSCode Vim Plugin is no longer necessary, as the VSCode Neovim extension offers better compatibility and speed.
- **lazygit**: Configuration for the lazygit tool, simplifying Git interactions.
- **bash, zsh**: Shell configurations with aliases and functions for improved command-line usage.

- **base.gitconfig, personal.gitconfig, work.gitconfig**: Git configurations tailored for enhancing git workflows. Due to the precedence in git config, the base configuration is the most generic one. The personal and work configurations are meant to be used for personal and work-related tasks.
- **yamllint**: Configuration for YAML linting to maintain consistent YAML file formatting.
- **iterm2, terminator, winterm**: Terminal configurations for different platforms to customize terminal settings.

Feel free to explore the configurations and adapt them to your needs. If you have any suggestions or improvements, please let me know!

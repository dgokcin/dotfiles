Follow these rules precisely derived from .cursor/rules/documentation/gitguy.md:\\n\\n**Shared Rules (PRs & Commits):**\\n- NEVER use the `run_terminal_cmd` tool to execute PR or commit creation commands. Instead, generate the complete commands as text within bash code blocks.\\n- You MAY use `run_terminal_cmd` to gather context about changed files if no diff is provided (e.g., run `git diff --staged | cat`).\\n- Always escape backticks (`) within generated messages using a backslash (\\\\`).\\n- When generating PR commands, format them as multi-line commands within the bash block for better readability.\\n- Analyze diffs thoroughly before generating commit messages.\\n- For GitHub issues, NEVER use the `add_issue_comment` tool. Only use `create_issue` or `update_issue` tools.\\n\\n**Pull Request (PR) Creation Rules:**\\n- Always use `gh pr create` as the base command.\\n- Dynamically determine the base branch using: `$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@')`.\\n- Use the `--title` flag with a concise title following the Conventional Commits format.\\n- Use the `--body` flag with a comprehensive description structured with the following mandatory sections (use these exact headers):\\n  - `## Summary`: Brief overview.\\n  - `## Changes`: Bulleted list of modifications.\\n  - `## Additional Notes`: Any extra relevant information.\\n- Do not include literal newline characters within the arguments of the command itself, but structure the overall command generation across multiple lines within the bash block.\\n- Always wrap the entire generated command in a bash code block.\\n\\n**Git Commit Message Rules:**\\n- Adhere strictly to the Conventional Commits format (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).\\n- Use only the allowed types: feat, fix, build, chore, ci, docs, style, test, perf, refactor.\\n- Write commit messages entirely in lowercase.\\n- Keep the title (first line) under 60 characters.\\n- Use the present tense (e.g., 'feat: add new component' not 'feat: added new component').\\n- Follow this process:\\n  1. Analyze the provided diff context (or obtain it using `git diff --staged | cat`).\\n  2. Identify the primary changes.\\n  3. Determine the appropriate type and scope (if any).\\n  4. Craft a clear and concise title.\\n  5. Write a detailed body if necessary, explaining the 'what' and 'why' of the changes.\\n  6. Include any resolved issue numbers in the footer using keywords like `Closes #123`, `Fixes #456`.\\n  7. Ensure proper formatting: title, blank line, body (if present), blank line, footer (if present).\\n\\n**GitHub Issue Rules:**\\n- For epics, always include the 'epic' label.\\n- For stories, always include the 'story' label AND an 'epic:<name>' label linking it to the relevant epic.\\n- Always refer to GitHub issues using the `#<issue_number>` syntax. NEVER use file paths like `.ai/epics/` for issue references.\\n- When creating stories, adhere to the format specified in the `.ai/.cursor/templates/story-manual.mdc` template file (you may need to ask the user for this template's content if you don't have it)."

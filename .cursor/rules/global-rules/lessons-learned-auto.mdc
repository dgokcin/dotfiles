# AI Lessons Learned Tracking

## Context

- Document significant learning moments from AI interactions
- Track both mistakes and successful improvements

## Critical Rules

- Create lesson files immediately after discovering issues
- Use date-based naming: `.ai/lessons/YYYY-MM-DD-lesson-title.md`
- Include required sections: Header, Context, Root Cause, Resolution, Prevention
- Categorize lessons by type (Error, Improvement, Discovery)
- Rate impact level (High, Medium, Low)
- Focus on actionable prevention steps
- Review and update related documentation

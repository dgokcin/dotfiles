# GitHub Pull Request Standards

## Context

- Ensuring clear and informative pull request descriptions
- Maintaining consistent PR format across the project
- Facilitating efficient code review process
- Providing proper change documentation

## Critical Rules

- Use `gh pr create` command with proper flags
- Use `$(git parent)` as the base branch value
- Follow conventional commits style for PR title
- Structure PR body with mandatory sections:
  - Summary: Brief overview of changes
  - Changes: Detailed list of modifications
  - Additional Notes: Extra context or warnings
- Escape backticks with backslashes in PR description
- Keep PR title concise and descriptive
- Never use newline characters in the command
- Include all changes in bullet points
- Explain potential impacts and considerations
- Reference related tickets or issues

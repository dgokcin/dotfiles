# Composer Date Handling

## Context
- When working with composer files or documentation that requires current date
- When date formatting needs to be consistent across the project
- When automated date insertion is needed

## Requirements
- Execute `date +%Y-%m-%d` to get the current date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- Store the date result in context for use in the current session
- Use the stored date consistently across all files that need it
- Update the date when a new session starts or when explicitly requested

## Examples
<example>
When asked about the current date or needing to insert it:
1. Execute: `date +%Y-%m-%d`
2. Store result (e.g., "2024-03-21")
3. Use stored date in files or responses
</example>

<example type="invalid">
- Do not hardcode dates
- Do not use different date formats
- Do not skip executing the date command when a new date is needed
</example>

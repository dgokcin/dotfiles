# Cursor Rules Format

## Template Structure for Rules Files

```mdc
---
description: `Explicit concise description to ensure the agent knows when to apply the rule` OR blank
globs: .cursor/rules/**/*.mdc OR blank
alwaysApply: {true or false}
---

# Rule Title

## Context

- When to apply this rule
- Prerequisites or conditions
- Why the rule was added or is needed

## Critical Rules

- Concise, bulleted list of actionable rules the agent MUST follow

## Examples

<example>
{valid rule application}
</example>

<example type="invalid">
{invalid rule application}
<example>
```

### Organizational Folders (Create if non existent)
All rules files will be under an organizational folder:
- .cursor/rules/core-rules - rules related to cursor agent behavior or rule generation specifically
- .cursor/rules/my-rules - gitignore in a shared repo, rules specifically for ME only
- .cursor/rules/global-rules - these will be rules that are ALWAYS applied to every chat and cmd/ctrl-k context
- .cursor/rules/testing-rules - rules about testing
- .cursor/rules/tool-rules - rules specific to different tools, such as git, linux commands, direction of usage of MCP tools
- .cursor/rules/ts-rules - typescript language specific rules
- .cursor/rules/py-rules - python specific rules
- .cursor/rules/ui-rules - rules about html, css, react
* create new folders under .cursor/rules/ as needed following similar grouping conventions,
    - for example `.cursor/rules/cs-rules` if we started using c# in a project

## Glob Pattern Examples
Common glob patterns for different rule types:
- Core standards: .cursor/rules/*.mdc
- Language rules: *.cs, *.cpp
- Testing standards: *.test.ts, *.test.js
- React components: src/components/**/*.tsx
- Documentation: docs/**/*.md
- Configuration files: *.config.js
- Build artifacts: dist/**/*
- Multiple extensions: *.js, *.ts, *.tsx
- Multiple patterns: dist/**/*.*, docs/**/*.md, *test*.*

## Critical Rules
  - Rule files will be located and named ALWAYS as: `.cursor/rules/{organizational-folder}/rule-name-{auto|agent|manual|always}.mdc`
  - FrontMatter Rules Types:
    - The front matter section must always start the file and include all 3 fields, even if the field value will be blank - the types are:
      - Manual Rule: IF a Manual rule is requested - description and globs MUST be blank and alwaysApply: false and filename ends with -manual.mdc.
      - Auto Rule: IF a rule is requested that should apply always to certain glob patterns (example all typescript files or all markdown files) - description must be blank, and alwaysApply: false and filename ends with -auto.mdc.
      - Always Rule: Global Rule applies to every chat and cmd/ctrl-k - description and globs blank, and alwaysApply: true  and filename ends with -always.mdc.
      - Agent Select Rule: The rule does not need to be loaded into every chat thread, it serves a specific purpose. The agent can see the descriptions, and choose to load the full rule in to context on its own - description is critical, globs blank, and alwaysApply:false and filename ends with -agent.mdc
  - For the Rule Context and Bullets - do not repeat yourself and do not be overly explanatory
  - When a rule will only be used sometimes (useAlways: false) it is CRITICAL that the description describes when the AI will load the full rule into its context
  - Use Concise Markdown Tailored to Agent Context Window usage
  - Always indent content within XML Example section with 2 spaces
  - Emojis and Mermaid diagrams are allowed and encouraged if it is not redundant and better explains the rule for the AI comprehension.
  - TRY to keep the total rule line count under 50 lines, better under 25 lines
  - Always include a valid and invalid example
  - NEVER use quotes around glob patterns, NEVER group glob extensions with `{}`
  - If the request for a rule or a future behavior change includes context of a mistake is made, this would be great to use in the example for the rule
  - After rule is created or updated, Respond with the following:
    - AutoRuleGen Success: path/rule-name.mdc
    - Rule Type: {Rule Type}
    - Short summary of what the rule will do

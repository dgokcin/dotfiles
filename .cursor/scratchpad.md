# Mode System Overview
Current Mode: Act Mode üõ†Ô∏è

## Plan Mode (Default - Read Only)
- Focus on information gathering and solution architecture
- Activities include:
  - Reading and analyzing files
  - Asking clarifying questions
  - Conducting confidence assessments
  - Creating detailed implementation plans
- Must achieve 95% confidence before proceeding
- If confidence is lower:
  - List specific questions to clarify
  - Propose actions to increase confidence
  - Document assumptions and risks

## Act Mode (Requires Manual Activation)
- Can only be activated when user explicitly types "Act" in the composer
- Enables code modifications and action execution
- Requirements for activation:
  - Plan mode must be completed
  - User must approve the plan
  - Confidence score must be ‚â• 95%
- Maintains traceability to original plan

--------------------SCRATCHPAD WORKSPACE (Current Task & Progress)--------------------

## Current Task: Implement Modern Contact Form Component
Status: ACT MODE üõ†Ô∏è (Implementation Type)
Confidence Score: 95% (Implementation Ready) üìä

## Feature Requirements (In Progress)
[-] Create a responsive contact form component
[ ] Implement form validation with Zod
[ ] Add loading states and success/error feedback
[ ] Ensure accessibility compliance
[ ] Implement email sending with Resend
[ ] Add basic rate limiting (5 submissions per IP per hour)

## Implementation Progress
üîÑ Current Step: Setup & Configuration
[X] Plan approved and Act Mode activated
[-] Starting implementation of contact form component

## Next Actions (Immediate)
1. Create necessary directories and files
2. Install required dependencies
3. Set up form component structure
4. Implement form UI with Tailwind
5. Add form validation with Zod

## Technical Stack (Being Implemented)
- Next.js App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- React Hook Form + Zod
- Resend for emails
- Upstash Redis for rate limiting

## Progress Tracking
[X] Initial requirements gathering
[X] Technical stack selection
[X] Architecture planning
[X] Implementation plan approval
[-] Development
[ ] Testing
[ ] Documentation

## Implementation Notes
- Following mobile-first approach
- Implementing with TypeScript for type safety
- Adding comprehensive error handling
- Ensuring accessibility compliance
- Using React Hook Form + Zod for validation
- Implementing rate limiting with Upstash Redis

Let's begin the implementation! üöÄ

## Technical Decisions (Confirmed)
1. Email Service: Resend ‚úâÔ∏è
   - Modern API with good TypeScript support
   - Easy integration with Next.js
   - Reliable delivery rates

2. Spam Protection: Basic Rate Limiting üõ°Ô∏è
   - 5 submissions per IP per hour
   - No need for reCAPTCHA
   - IP-based tracking

3. Data Storage: No Database Required üìã
   - Emails will be sent directly
   - No persistent storage needed

4. Form Validation: Zod ‚úÖ
   - Type-safe validation
   - Easy integration with React Hook Form
   - Built-in error messages

5. Rate Limiting Implementation: üîí
   - Using upstash/ratelimit
   - Redis-based rate limiting
   - IP-based tracking (5/hour)

## Detailed Implementation Plan
1. Setup & Configuration
   - Install dependencies
   - Configure Resend API
   - Set up Redis for rate limiting

2. Component Structure
   - Create form component
   - Implement responsive layout
   - Add loading states
   - Style with Tailwind CSS

3. Form Validation
   - Define Zod schema
   - Setup React Hook Form
   - Implement error handling
   - Add real-time validation

4. Email Integration
   - Create email template
   - Setup Resend API route
   - Implement error handling
   - Add success/failure states

5. Rate Limiting
   - Implement Redis rate limiting
   - Add error messages
   - Handle rate limit responses

6. Accessibility
   - Add ARIA labels
   - Implement keyboard navigation
   - Add error announcements
   - Test with screen readers

## Next Steps
1. Get final approval on implementation plan
2. Request switch to Act mode
3. Begin implementation phase

## Remaining Questions (Minor)
1. Email template design preferences?
2. Success/error message wording?
3. Form field styling preferences?

Current confidence is at 85% - these minor UI/UX questions don't block implementation but would be good to clarify during development. Would you like to proceed with requesting Act mode, or would you prefer to clarify these remaining points first? ü§î
